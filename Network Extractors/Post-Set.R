## ****************************************************
## Created: Adam Cooper, Cetis, Nov 2013
## This source code was produced for The University of
## Edinburgh DEI as part of their MOOC initiative.
## Exctracts edge and node data according to rules for
## what constitutes a tie and saves to graphml and
## RData containing a network class object
## ****************************************************

# nodes = user (person). Deleted/withdrawn people are excluded
# edges = between people who commented on the same post, or between poster and commenter
#   (i.e. this includes all ties in Poster-Commenter but adds C-C AND the network is UNDIRECTED)
# forum_user_id is the key for nodes
# nodes have attributes: role (access_group_id)

## this shares a lot with Poster-Commenter.R. Refactor at leisure (but watch for directed/undirected)!!!
