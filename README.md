EdMOOC-SNA
==========
_This repo is a store of my messy work in progress of SNA and related bits, shared with David and Edinburgh Uni folks for visibility._

In general, files of type ... are ...:
* html - output reports, notebooks etc (include code fragments to document process)
* rmd - mixed R code and markdown intended to be put through _knitr_ to generate the html file with the same stem
* md - markdown file auto-generated by knitr in most cases
* R - R code, likely to be for pre-processing or including in rmd
* RData - typically one or more dataframes with some metadata, the stored result of executing the R or rmd with the same filename stem

Basic Forum Stats
---------
Looks at macro-level stats for forums per course: aggregate descriptive quantities and high level structural features. Some of this also appears in the 1st MOOC Report; this is partially a database familiarisation activity augmented by some processing to get some more basic numbers to inform next-steps and contextualise results.
